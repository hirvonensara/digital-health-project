# Digital Health and Human Behavior 2021 project: 
# Classifying depressed patients using diurnal activity patterns
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of this project was to explore whether the diurnal activity patterns could be
used in diagnosing depressed people, i.e. classifying depressed and non-depressed
people. We used the activity dataset including the actigraph watch measurements
from 23 condition group subjects and 32 control group subjects. The data was gathered by Garcia-Ceja et al. in their study in 2018. In their study, Garcia-Ceja et al. (2018) conducted similar kind of classification, however, instead of diurnal rhythms, they used only single statistical values from each subject: the overall mean activity and the overall standard deviation of the mean activity. 

The methods included exploring the diurnal activity patterns using descriptive analytics and based on that, feature extraction was conducted. Four different classi-
2 fication methods were used and evaluated with multiple metrics. Key result of the project was that the diurnal activity patterns can be used in this kind of classification, but more research on the topic is required.

This project was done for the course Digital Health and Human Behavior in Aalto University.
